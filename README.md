# Cupfinity?

This scad will create a holder for Gridfinity bins. There are lots of bins for Gridfinity, and there are lots of plates and drawers, but I wanted a simple 'cup' (for lack of a better term) to hold my bins in. 

If you adjust the `grid_x` and `grid_y`, you can change the number of grid nodes, while `wall_height` and `wall_thickness` affect the -- well I'll let you figure it out. 

The grid insets take up some height, so the one gotcha here is that if you set the `floor_height` to less than 5, it will create holes in the floor. If you're after that, cool. If not, well, set it to 6. 5 might work but it might be too thin, and I'm not going to waste the filament to test it.
